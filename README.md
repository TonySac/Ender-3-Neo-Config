# Klipper Configurations for my Ender 3 Neo

The current configuration files for my Ender 3 Neo.

:warning: This is a working repo. Meaning I'm constantly tinkering with this configuration.

I've broken out some macros into a seperate file.

Klipper is hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4B. The GPIO is used for LED control, input shaping, and some temerpature sensing. 

The printer is currenty running on a BTT SKR Mini E3 v3 with a CR Touch configured. 

Feel free to reference this as a starting point but it is not reccomended to copy/paste these as is.

I've also included the last working configuration used for Klipper on my Creality v4.2.2 mainboard.
