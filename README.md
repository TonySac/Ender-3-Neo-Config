# Klipper Configuration for my Ender 3 Neo

⚠️ Depricated ⚠️ I have not updated this repo with any changes to my config or hardware since Dec 2023. As of March 2024, I have converted this printer into an [Ender 3 Next Generation](https://www.printables.com/model/469280-ender-3-ng-corexy-beta). My build log can be found [here](https://e3nglog.themakermedic.com).

The previous configuration files for my Ender 3 Neo.

Previously hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4, now moved to an [Inovato Quadra](https://inovato.com).

Some features inlcude:
* Input shaping
* Pressure advance
* Temperature monitoring
* KAMP add on

Current hardware:
* Ender 3 Neo
* CR Touch
* BTT SKR Mini E3 v3

Future plans:
* Clean up configuration files
* Advanced macros
* Include slicer profiles
* Switchwire conversion

Feel free to reference this as a starting point but it is not reccomended to copy/paste these as is.

For reference, I've also included my last working Klipper configuration for a Creality v4.2.2 mainboard.
